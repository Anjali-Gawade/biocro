BioCro uses software from the Boost project for C++. Not all of Boost needs to be included, and this document lists steps to extract the relevant portion of Boost.

BioCro uses the units and odeint packages. To extract them use the bcp tool included with Boost. bcp accepts a list of files or modules and extracts the relevant parts of the Boost library to a directory.
The modules BioCro uses are as follows:
"boost/units"
"boost/typeof/incr_registration_group.hpp" -- This is needed for boost/units but it is not exported properly and must be explicitly specificed as of Boost version 1.64
"boost/numeric/odeint"

1: Run the following command:
    bcp --boost="PATH_TO_BOOST_ROOT_DIRECTORY" "boost/units" "boost/typeof/incr_registration_group.hpp" "boost/numeric/odeint" PATH_TO_TEMPORARY_DIRECTORY
2: Copy PATH_TO_TEMPORARY_DIRECTORY/boost to the biocro/src/boost_[version_number] directory. Other files and directories my be created in PATH_TO_TEMPORARY_DIRECTORY, but they are not needed.
3: If necessary, updated the PKG_CPPFLAGS line in biocro/src/Makevars
    E.g., PKG_CPPFLAGS=-I"boost_1_64_0"
