This workflow, Update Documentation, runs Doxygen in various
configurations on the BioCro C++ Library source code and copies and
commits the result to the repository given as the value of the
"publish-to" environment variable, currently
"ebimodeling/biocro-documentation".  That repository is, in turn, set
up to publish to GitHub pages at the corresponding canonical location
(currently, https://ebimodeling.github.io/biocro-documentation/).

In order for this to all work correctly, a number of set-up steps were
required.

1. An SSH public/private key pair was generated using the command
`ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096`.

2. The private key was added as a secret in the
`ebimodeling/biocro-dev` repository (this repository) under the key
PRIVATE_SSH_KEY.  (This matches the reference
`secrets.PRIVATE_SSH_KEY` used in the `document.yml` workflow file.)

3. The "ebimodeling/biocro-documentation" repository was created.

4. A README.md file was created in this new repository with (relative)
links pointing to the various versions of the Doxygen documentation.

5. GitHub pages was enabled for the "ebimodeling/biocro-documentation"
repository.

6. The public SSH key was added as a deploy key to the
"ebimodeling/biocro-documentation" repository under the name "Access
from biocro-dev action".  (This name is for informational purposes
only and has no programmatic significance.)
