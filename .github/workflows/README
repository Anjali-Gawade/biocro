This workflow, Update Documentation, runs Doxygen in various
configurations on the BioCro C++ Library source code and copies and
commits the result to the repository given as the value of the
"publish-to" environemnt variable, currently
"ebimodeling/biocro-documentation".  That repository is, in turn, set
up to publish to GitHub pages at the corresponding canonical location
(currently, https://ebimodeling.github.io/biocro-documentation/).

In order for this to all work correctly, a number of set-up steps were
required.

1. A new user, "biocro-service-account", was created.

2. A Personal Access Token with repository permissions was created for
this new user.

3. The "ebimodeling/biocro-documentation" repository was created.

4. A README.md file was created in this new repository with (relative)
links pointing to the various version of the Doxygen documentation.

5. GitHub pages was enabled for the "ebimodeling/biocro-documentation"
repository.

6. The new user was invited to be an external collaborator on the
ebimodeling/biocro-documentation repository and given read and write
access to the repository.

7. The new user accepted the invitation.

8. The new user's Personal Access Token was stored as a secret in
*this* repository (ebimodeling/biocro-dev) under the key
API_TOKEN_GITHUB.
