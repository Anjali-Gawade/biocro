## BioCro [![Build Status](https://magnum.travis-ci.com/ebimodeling/biocro-dev.svg?token=tjzJV6N6JPssJ6yfYPqH&branch=master)](https://magnum.travis-ci.com/ebimodeling/biocro-dev)

BioCro is a model that predicts plant growth over time given climate as input.


BioCro was adapted from WIMOVAC and models key physiological and biophysical processes underlying plant growth ([Humphries & Long, 1995]). BioCro has previously been used for predicting biomass yield and leaf area index of switchgrass and miscanthus ([Miguez et al., 2009]).

BioCro has also been integrated into a suite of tools which link the model directly with crop trait and yield data, streamlining the entire modeling and data collection workflow (LeBauer et al, 2013). The Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer [(PEcAn)](https://github.com/PecanProject/pecan) couples BioCro to the [Biofuel Ecophysiological Traits and Yields database](https://www.betydb.org), enabling model parameterization and optimization, targeted data collection optimized to reduce uncertainty in model predictions, and the management of informatics and HPC computing resources.
