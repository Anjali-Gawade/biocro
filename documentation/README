# Generating Documentation

To generate documentation for the C/C++ code, we use Doxygen.

## Installing and Running Doxygen and Related Tools

###  Ubuntu Linux

```sh
## download doxygen and graphviz applications using a the software manager:
sudo apt-get install doxygen graphviz

## compile documentation
cd /path/to/biocro/documentation
doxygen Doxyfile

###  Windows: 

1. Download and install doxygen binary distribution from
<http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html#srcbin>. After instalation
open the doxywizard program.

2. Select the Biocro directory as the working directory from which doxygen will
run. Ctrl+O and find the Biocro directory and select Doxyfile to open. Then
select run and run doxygen.

## Viewing the Documentation

After respective processes have been completed, a new directory under called
html/ will be created under documentation directory.  Point your browser to
/path/to/biocro/documentation/html/index.html
