## Using Doxygen

To generate documentation (skip to step two if you have already downloaded and installed respevitve application):


###  Ubuntu Linux


```sh
## download doxygen application from the software manager.   
sudo apt-get install doxygen graphviz
## compile documentation
cd /path/to/biocro/documentation
doxygen doxyfile
firefox html/index.html
```

###  Windows: 

1. Download and install doxygen binary distribution from <http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html#srcbin>. After instalation open doxywizard program. 
2. Select the Biocro directory as the working directory from which doxygen will run. Ctrl+O and find the Biocro directory and select Doxyfile to open. Then select run and run doxygen.


After respective processes have been completed, a new directory under called latex/ will be created under documentation directory. A latex file called refman.tex will exist under the new latex dierectory. compile refman.tex into a pdf to view documentation. another latex file called equations.tex in the documentation directory already documents the equations on which BioCro is based.
