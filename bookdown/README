This directory contains configuration files for generating a
*bookdown* compilation of the BioCro documentation files meant for
developers.  It also includes the "index.Rmd" file that specifies the
list of source files used in generating that documentation.  Markdown
files for the book that don't logically belong elsewhere can be added
to the subdirectory "book_source".

To generate a *bookdown* book of this documentation, do as follows:

1. Start an R session.

2. Install the R "bookdown" package, if it hasn't been installed
already.  These instructions are written for bookdown version 0.22 or
greater but may work for other versions.

3. Call either "bookdown::render_book(<path>)" or
"rmarkdown::render_site(<path>)", where "<path>" denotes the path from
the current directory to the "bookdown" directory (i.e., *this*
directory).  If either command is run *from* this directory
("bookdown"), the path argument may be omitted.

Note: If using a version of bookdown below version 0.22, either
compile the book using "rmarkdown::render_site(<path>)" or run
"bookdown::render_book()" from the "bookdown" directory.

Note: Because some sections of the book are contained in their own
files rather than being in a larger file comprising a complete
chapter, you will get a warning such as the following, which may be
safely ignored:

"In split_chapters(output, gitbook_page, number_sections, split_by,  :
  You have 11 Rmd input file(s) but only 7 first-level heading(s). Did you forget first-level headings in certain Rmd files?"

4. In a Web browser, open bookdown/_book/index.html.
