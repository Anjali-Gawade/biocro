This directory contains configuration files for generating a
*bookdown* compilation of the BioCro documentation files meant for
developers as well as including a portion of the *.md files comprising
that documentation.

To generate a *bookdown* book of this documentation, do as follows:

1. Start an R session.

2. Install the R "bookdown" package, if it hasn't been installed
already.

3. Call "rmarkdown::render_site(<path>)", where "<path>" denotes the
path from the current directory to the documentaiton directory (i.e.,
*this* directory).

4. In a Web browser, open documentation/_book/index.html.
