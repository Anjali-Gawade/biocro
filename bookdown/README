This directory contains configuration files for generating a
*bookdown* compilation of the developer-oriented BioCro documentation
files.  In addition, it contains a few of the Markdown files
comprising that documentation.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPILING THE BOOKDOWN BOOK

To generate a *bookdown* book of this documentation, do as follows:

1. Install Pandoc, if it is not already on your system.  See
https://pandoc.org/installing.html for instructions.  (Note to RStudio
users: As mentioned in the R Markdown Cookbook
(https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/install-pandoc.html),
RStudio comes with its own copy of Pandoc, so you may be able to get
by without installing it separately.)

2. Start an R session.

3. Install the R "bookdown" package, if it hasn't been installed
already.

4. Run the R function to compile the Bookdown book.

Method A: Call "rmarkdown::render_site('<path>')", where "<path>"
denotes the path from the current directory to the bookdown directory
(i.e., *this* directory).

Method B: Call "xfun::in_dir('<path>', bookdown::render_book('.'))",
where "<path>" denotes the path from the current directory to the
bookdown directory (*this* directory).  If you are *in* the bookdown
directory, you may simply call "bookdown::render_book('.')".

Note: Because some sections of the book are contained in their own
files rather than being in a larger file comprising a complete
chapter, you will get a warning such as the following, which may be
safely ignored:

"In split_chapters(output, gitbook_page, number_sections, split_by,  :
  You have 11 Rmd input file(s) but only 7 first-level heading(s). Did you forget first-level headings in certain Rmd files?"

4. In a Web browser, open bookdown/_book/index.html.
