This directory contains configuration files for generating a
*bookdown* compilation of the BioCro documentation files meant for
developers.  It also includes the "index.Rmd" file that specifies the
list of source files used in generating that documentation.  Markdown
files for the book that don't logically belong elsewhere can be added
to the subdirectory "book_source".
